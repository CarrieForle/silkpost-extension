## Install

It's not on any extension store at the moment, and probably would never be on Chrome Web Store as I don't have developer account and I have to pay $5 to be one. You need to do a manual installation. 

### Firefox

Download the latest [`silkpost-extension.zip`](https://github.com/CarrieForle/silkpost-extension/releases/latest) from Release page. Unzip it.

Go to [about:debugging](about:debugging) and click "This Firefox" on the left.

Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select ANY file from the extension folder.
